# About

I'm Yong-Xiang (Sean) Lin, a dedicated researcher and engineer with a focus on Computer Science and Information Engineering. Engaged in a Ph.D. at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, I delve into advanced research areas like deep learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on generative AI and large language models (LLMs).

My journey in AI research is marked by a successful track record of translating theoretical concepts into practical applications, especially in the realms of generative AI and LLMs. I've developed sophisticated models that push the frontiers of how we interpret and generate data. My proficiency in leveraging Microsoft's ecosystem, notably Azure and AutoGen, to merge multiple LLMs, stands out as a testament to my ability to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AI systems.

I distinguish myself by swiftly understanding and addressing client needs, devising tailored AI solutions that empower organizations across various sectors, including research institutes, the gaming industry, and electronics. My project management skills shine through as I identify client needs, define actionable project scopes, and deliver detailed reports. My portfolio showcases extensive AI project engagements with leading entities like the ITRI, the Institute for Information Industry, IGS Inc., and Delta Electronics, highlighting my skill in navigating and solving multifaceted challenges. My collaboration with Microsoft's CTO on AI/LLM projects using AutoGen exemplifies my capability in crafting comprehensive solutions.

Leadership is a cornerstone of my professional identity, particularly demonstrated during my Ph.D., where I mentored over 20 master's students, promoting a culture of innovation and scholarly pursuit. My collaborative efforts with professors across various disciplines, such as Computer Science and Engineering, Industrial Management, and Electronics Engineering, illustrate my versatile leadership style. My role as President of the NTUST Computer Club during my undergraduate years further reflects my ability to lead and inspire a community engaged in technology and innovation.

I am actively seeking new opportunities and am prepared to join a forward-thinking team by the end of this year. My interests lie in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and AI Research, and I am open to roles in Taiwan, other Asian locales, or remotely, eager to contribute to projects that harness AI for transformative outcomes.

For potential collaborations or career opportunities, I encourage you to reach out to me on LinkedIn. I am excited about the possibility of leveraging my AI expertise to contribute to your organization's success.
